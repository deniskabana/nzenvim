# Settings for NEOVIM

This is my **init.vim** file where I'll keep my settings and updates up-to-date with my VIM.

**NOTE:** It requires `vim-plug` and [neovim](https://neovim.io/) with Python 3 in order to run correctly with all the plugins. Best used from iTerm 2 with 24-bit color support.

Screenshots from using neovim.
