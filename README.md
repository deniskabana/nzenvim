# ηZenvim
A vim config that works wonderfully. On any platform.

## BETA VERSION ONLY
Keep this in mind, please.

### What is ηZenvim?
Currently a long lasting on-going progress to create a modern text editor (still not an IDE) **heavily centered around web technologies**. The main goal is to achieve rapid load times, fastest possible usage and keep good looks.

(Latest neovim running with ηZenvim, Hasklig font and ligatures on iTerm3).

### Current stage of development
Unfortunately, due to the number of issues this is still a work in progress but is in no way in danger as I still use vim with passion daily.

I use vim **full-time**. And to be able to do that, I had to create *the perfect config™*. And it also looks good and modern with this config (see the screenshot for yourself).

### Looking for help
I very much appreciate anyone using this config - it works well with any javascript related language, framework, superset etc. as well as styles, node.js, python and module importing in any language.

However due to serious lack of time I am unable to devote enough time to cope with all the features. I am accepting issue reports (these can even be suggestions) from anyone as well as PRs with good reasoning and solid code. Before merging, I will do some manual testing.

**Always looking for enthusiastic developers!**
